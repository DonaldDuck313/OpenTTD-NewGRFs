# Hybrid Trains
This NewGRF contains three hybrid locomotives: [electric/diesel hybrid B82500 'Bibi'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCF_Class_B_82500), [electric/diesel hybrid Regiolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9giolis) and [electric/battery hybrid Regiolis](https://www.sncf.com/fr/innovation-developpement/innovation-recherche/ter-a-batteries).

List of vehicles:

Name | Introduction year | Available until | Maximum speed | Running cost (varies with inflation)
---- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------
B82500 'Bibi' | 2004 | 2034 | 160 km/h | Doubled when running on non-electric tracks
B83500 'Regiolis' | 2014 | 2044 | 200 km/h | Doubled when running on non-electric tracks
Battery-driven B84500 'Regiolis' | 2023 | Model never expires | 200 km/h | Never doubled

All locomotives have a capacity of 20 passengers per locomotive, and are refittable to any cargo type except liquids.

There is a setting which allows you to choose the power of the locomotives. If you activate that setting, the powers are adjusted to match the powers of similar original OpenTTD locomotives, otherwise they use their real life power. Activating the setting is recommended, because their real life power is much lower than the powers of the original OpenTTD locomotives, making the hybrid locomotives less useful.

&nbsp;                              | Power setting activated | Power setting inactivated
----------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------
**Train on electrified tracks**     | 3500 hp                 | 1775 hp
**Train on non-electrified tracks** | 7000 hp                 | 2547 hp
