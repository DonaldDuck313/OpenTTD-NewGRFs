STR_GRF_NAME:Hybrid Trains
STR_GRF_DESCRIPTION:This NewGRF contains two hybrid electric/diesel locomotives and one hybrid electric/battery locomotive. They can run in diesel/battery mode on non-electrified tracks, but are more powerful and have a cheaper running cost when run in electric mode on electrified tracks.
STR_B82500_NAME:B 82500 'Bibi' (Hybrid)
STR_B83500_NAME:B 83500 'Regiolis' (Hybrid)
STR_BATTERY_NAME:Battery-driven B 84500 'Regiolis' (Hybrid)

STR_PARAM_NAME_ADJUST_POWER:Adjust powers to match those of original locomotives
STR_PARAM_DESC_ADJUST_POWER:If this setting is activated, the power of the hybrid locomotives will approximately match the power of original diesel OpenTTD locomotives on non-electrified tracks, and the power of original electric OpenTTD locomotives on electrified tracks. Otherwise, the power of the hybrid locomotives will be the same as in real life, which is significantly lower.
