# Early Vehicle Set

This NewGRF contains road vehicles that appear from 1700 and trains that appear from 1830, so that you can start games earlier. For early ships, you can use the [Sailing Ships](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?t=49040) NewGRF by J Mitchell.

Graphics are based on various graphics by the [OpenGFX team](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenGFX), licensed under the GPL v2.
