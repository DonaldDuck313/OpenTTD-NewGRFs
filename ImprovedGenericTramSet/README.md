This NewGRF is based on the Generic Tram Set (licensed under Creative Commons 3.0), but contains several improvements, such as:

- It makes sure that at least one tram is available at all times after the first tram is introduced, as opposed to the Generic Tram Set where no trams at all are available after 2050.
- It allows trams to be refitted to transport any cargo, making it compatible with industry replacement sets such as FIRS.
