# Water Treatment Plant as Industry
This NewGRF adds water treatment plants as industries in the tropical climate. Water treatment plants are built by the sea and produce water. If you use this NewGRF in combination with FIRS, they also accept chemicals.

This NewGRF also improves the standard water supply so that it never closes.

This NewGRF is compatible with FIRS. If you use it with FIRS, it will also re-enable the standard water supply and water tower industries, though the water supplies will never close using this NewGRF.

If you use this NewGRF in combination with FIRS, for it to work as intended, it needs to be *after* FIRS in the "Active NewGRF-files" list.
