# Articulated Road Vehicles Set
This NewGRF adds articulated buses and trucks with the same style as the original vehicles. The latest version of each road vehicle in the Original Vehicles Cargo Set has an articulated counterpart in this set.

These vehicles can be refitted to transport most cargos from FIRS, ECS and other industry sets.

The articulated vehicles in this set are more expensive and slower than their non-articulated counterparts, so it's a good idea to still use the original vehicles on routes that aren't that busy.
