# Valuables for Arctic and Tropical Climates
This NewGRF modifies the arctic and tropical banks so that they produce and accept valuables, in addition to accepting gold or diamonds.

This NewGRF can also be used in combination with FIRS to re-enable banks in any climate.

In order to be able to transport valuables in the arctic and tropical climates, you need to use a NewGRF such as the [ECS & FIRS vehicle set](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=52116).
